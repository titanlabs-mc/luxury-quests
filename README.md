A great and open source quests plugins

## Why open source?

Multiple reasons. One is so that others can help us more. Another is so we can be more transparent and then just the fact that it relieves some stress for us. Feel free to purchase the plugin on Spigot or compile it from here, but if you want the full version from here, make sure to read the section below (you'd have to get all the dependencies, the premium ones may be a lot harder).

## Contributing

We're open to people fixing issues, helping add new features or letting us know of anything. We do ask that if you make pull requests, you follow the same code style to keep the project clean and concise.

## For Developers

Trying to compile this? It won't work out of the box because of the massive amount of dependencies we have which we of course won't release, they're premium plugins. You can delete the classes from the quests.quests.external package named {plugin-name}Quests. You will also need to delete them from the QuestRegistry class.

## About our contributions

If you go to contribution history, you can see I commited all the code here. This is not realistic and at least 75% - 80% of the code is by Hyfe as I simply just moved the code over from a private to a public repo.
